// Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior in which variable and function declarations are moved ("hoisted") to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase â€” before the code is executed

//var is hoisted, but only the declaration, not the value assignment
console.log(test);
var test = "Hey";

// let and const are also hoisted, but not initialization. They are in a "Temporal Dead Zone" from the start of the block until the declaration line.

console.log(demo);
let demo = 5;
